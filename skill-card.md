| **Skill Name** | UGC Comment Insights Miner |
| **Owner** | Tom — Content Writer |
| **What Gets Automated** | Collects, filters, and classifies community insights from comment threads (Reddit, X, YouTube, forums) into 5 ready-to-use blog sections: Counter-Arguments, Real-World FAQs, Personal Experiences, Viral Pattern Analysis, and Blog Cross-Reference |
| **BEFORE: Manual Process** | Writer opens Reddit/X/forums, scrolls through hundreds of comments, tries to find the good ones while battling noise and fatigue. Cherry-picks a few quotes, rewrites them manually. Result: 1-2 hours spent, most of it wasted on low-value comments. Most writers skip this entirely — articles ship without real community voice |
| **AFTER: With Skill** | Paste 1-3 URLs (or paste comment text if platform blocks fetch) → skill auto-processes in 1-2 minutes → complete markdown report with engagement data, quality scoring, and viral analysis. Copy-paste sections into blog, touch up in <5 minutes |
| **Input Options** | **Option A:** Paste URL(s) — skill auto-fetches. **Option B:** Paste comment text directly — for platforms that block fetching (X, Reddit). Both produce the same quality output |
| **Output** | Markdown report: Executive Summary, 3 Insight Categories (counter-arguments, FAQs, experiences), Viral Pattern Analysis, optional Blog Cross-Reference with gap detection |
| **Tools/AI Used** | Claude (SKILL.md prompt engineering), web_fetch (URL fetching), Claude Projects |
| **Tested With** | X thread (Matt Shumer "Something Big Is Happening") — 18 comments analyzed, full report generated. Reddit threads — paste workflow tested successfully |
| **Limitations** | X/Twitter and Reddit often block direct fetching (workaround: paste content). JS-rendered comments may not load. Max 100 comments per URL. No scheduled monitoring |
| **Expansion Roadmap** | Phase 2: Multi-link batch (5-10 URLs), template variants by blog type, brand voice calibration. Phase 3: Browser extension "X Learning Companion" — smart bookmarks, profile tracker, daily digest |
